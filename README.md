# ML-Nanodegree-Program
Project  files from the Udacity ML Nanodegree program

This repository logs my coursework completed for the Udacity ML Nanodegree program.

Main projects:

Project 1 - Predicting Boston Housing Prices
The task is to practice:
- initially exploring data
- training and testing models
- identifying overfitting/underfitting issues
- applying cross-validation and tuning techniques such as GridSearchCV and Kfold.

Project 2 - Supervised Learning Project - Finding Donors for CharityML
The task is to explore census data and attempt to predict whether a resident earns >50K or <=50K annually. This information can then be used to target donation brochures for CharityML, a fictional charity organization.

The project explores and compares various supervised learning algorithms. An optimal algorithm is ultimately chosen and tuned.

Project 3 - Unsupervised Learning Project - Finding Customer Clusters on Product Spending data of a Whole Distributor Customer Data in Lisbon, Portugal.
The dataset is taken from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers

The tasks are to:
- Analyze the dataset using simple statistical methods
- Preprocess data using PCA transformations
- Implement a clustering algorithm to determine customer segments
- Compare the cluster results to hidden labels in the dataset
